Keanu Reeves/ matrix/ Lana Wachowski * Lilly Wachowski

I would like to set up a search engine where you can login if you may.
Search on 3 categories save the data local maybe with the help of cookies
(The front will be in a cinematic style for sure. With pictures.)


1. you login

2. you search criteria:

Titles by Keyword / Titles by Title / Actors / Actor By Id /

3. you can see your stored data from before (so I need some backend that has space.)

4. via your stored data you can keep looking for names of movies by categories
Titles by Keyword / Titles by Title / Actors / Actor By Id


(I would like to look for another backend but I am not set on one yet.)

and then I will get all the info over the picture or the actor.

Thank you for reading this
You can make notes in Dutch off course
